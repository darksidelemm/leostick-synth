leostick-synth
==============

A quick bit of fun to make a 3-poly synth out of 3 Freetronics Leosticks.

Upload the Arduino code in Leostick_synth to the Leosticks, configure synthcontroller.py to reflect your serial port names and midi device number, then run synthcontroller.py.

TODO: Make this work with an arbitrary number of Leosticks, not just 3...
